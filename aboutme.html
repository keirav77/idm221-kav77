 <p>Hello! My name is Keira Vaughan! I am a Sophomore User Experience and Interaction Design major at Drexel University. I am a transfer student and used to go to the University of Rhode Island.
 During my time there I was apart of their rowing team and won an Atlantic 10 Conference Title! I love solving problems, and making experiences more enjoyable for everyone! I am very driven, and constantly strive to strengthen my skills, designs, and processes.
I am from Havertown, Pennsylvania and love all things Philadelphia!</p>
