      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hey! My name is Keira Vaughan! I am a Sophomore User Experience and Interaction Design major at Drexel University. I love solving problems, and making experiences more enjoyable for everyone! I am very driven, and constantly strive to strengthen my skills, designs, and processes.
I am from Havertown, Pennsylvania and have lived there my whole life!
</p>
<h2>Interests & Hobbies</h2>
    Outside of Designing I love to cook, watch movies, go to the gym, and listen to music. (I love getting music recommendations) I also dog sit and have two dogs of my own, their names are Maddie & Mabel.
