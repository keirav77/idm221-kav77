            <h2>Intro to Design for Media Work </h2>
            <h3> 1: Static & Dynamic Compositions using simple shapes.</h3>

           <p>Above is a project, in my design class, focusing on Static/Dynamic shapes on Adobe Illustrator. The 3 sections include exact symmetry, asymmetry, and implied balance. The main aspect of the project is was that the shapes have to still look like the shapes, but we were able to distort them. The goal was to make the designs almost look 50/50.
For the next step the task was to pair a static and a dynamic design, and paint it them. The left design is my dynamic painting because there is two ways of looking at it. For the second design I made it static, because there is not much movement. Overall, I was happy with the outcome of these two images together!

            <h3>Project 2: Expressive Line Quality with a Figure and Ground relationship </h3>

       <p> The goal of this project was to create expressive lines that derive from my Initials. On the right 3, the goal was to create backgrounds based off of real life things outdoors.
             For example on the right the top was a pothole with cracks around it, the one below is the structure below a bridge, and the last one was crates on the sidewalk. Being able to abstract these everyday items was a fun and interesting process, because it caused me to think outside of the box.</p>

    <p> I've always loved to take photos of moments that inspire me. I take photos on my Phone Fujifilm X-A1. In the beginning it started as a hobby, but as time went on, I have started to realize I implement fundamentals I learn in design classes.
        Some examples of this are, composition of a photo, lighting, and color relationships. This helps me visualize what I create digtially vs in the real world.
